# Python-Banking-App
A fake banking app created in python as my final project for school.

This program was made for the final project of my software design course. This program was created by just me across a two week span which included other school work. The goal of this program is to create a application that emulates an ATM with focus on the software rather than design. Using user stories to focus on tasks, i created two parts for this program. The first part is the ATM GUI, while the second is the ATM CLI. This program was created using MCV, with Tkinter as the view, and csv files as the Model

**ATM GUI**

The ATM GUI was mainly designed for users of the atm. the design emulates a typical ATM with giant buttons and similar options.
The ATM GUI is what users would use to do typical transactions such as deposit/withdrawel of money.

**ATM CLI**

The ATM CLI was designed for admins of the bank. This allows admins to do basic user account management tasks such as creating and editing accounts.

**Product Usage**
To launch the ATM GUI use the "atm_controller.exe" located inside dist/atm_controller. To login with a test account use the card number "1111" and the pin number "123".
To launch the ATM CLI use the "cli_controller" located inside dist/cli_controller.

Note - Due to time constraints certain functionality such as the QR button were never finished.
